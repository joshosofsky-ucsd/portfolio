            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I am a passionate and driven college student pursuing a degree in Data Science at UC San Diego. My interests lie at the intersection of technology, problem-solving, and creativity. I enjoy working on challenging projects that allow me to apply my skills in data analysis, algorithms, and software development.

            With hands-on experience in programming and a strong foundation in data structures, I am always eager to learn and explore new opportunities to grow. Outside of academics, I am a dedicated learner of Spanish, an avid reality show fan, and I have a soft spot for cats, thanks to years of being my sister's go-to cat sitter. I strive to bring a unique perspective to my work, blending analytical thinking with creative solutions.</p>
